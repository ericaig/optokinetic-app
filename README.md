# Optokinetic App

## Optokinetic reflex
The optokinetic response is a combination of a slow-phase and fast-phase eye movements. It is seen when an individual tracks a moving object with their eyes, which then moves out of the field of vision at which point their eye moves back to the position it was in when it first saw the object. [Wikipedia](Wikipedia)

## Optokinetic purpose
The optokinetic reflex is extremely important for stabilizing the image of visual input on the retina and provides for primary control of this capacity when the head is stationary. It interacts with the vestibular optic reflex when the head is rotating in stationary visual environment. [Cohen R.A. (2011) Optokinetic Reflex. In: Kreutzer J.S., DeLuca J., Caplan B. (eds) Encyclopedia of Clinical Neuropsychology. Springer, New York, NY. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-79948-3_1392](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-79948-3_1392)

## Optokinetic function
The optokinetic reflex allows the eyes to follow objects in motion while the head remains stationary. This function is performed within the central vestibular system [Michelle Petrak, Ph.D.](https://www.interacoustics.com/guides/test/balance-tests/optokinetics-okn)
